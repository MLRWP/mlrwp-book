# Foundations 


The Foundations Workstream aims to provide a path to gaining competency in common statistical and machine learning techniques by:

- creating a roadmap of methods to learn
- gathering together relevant learning materials and,
- developing notebooks in R and Python with example code, where the methods are applied to reserving data sets.



Our [workstream page](https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/workstreams/foundations/) contains a list of useful resources as well as links to our posts, which are reproduced here.
